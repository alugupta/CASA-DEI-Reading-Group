# CASA DEI Reading Group

The Computer Architecture Student Association (CASA) held a summer reading group on advancing and promoting DEI in computer architecture between June 2021 and August 2021. A call for participation was shared on the [SIGARCH blog post](https://www.sigarch.org/advancing-and-promoting-dei-in-computer-architecture-summer-2021-reading-group/#undefined). 

This repository provides additional details on the reading group including reading material, notes, and format for the reading group. We hope this helps organize similar reading groups in the future!

## Motivation

Building an inclusive and safe research community requires collective efforts from all members. Here, we propose a reading group, organized by CASA focused on broadening participation in systems and computer architecture. The reading group is open to all computer architecture researchers and will foster among members on how to build safer and more inclusive environments. The readings comprise books, publications, and case studies across STEM. 

## Goals

1. Provide a venue for computer architecture researchers and practitioners to study and discuss challenges and paths for broadening participation in computer architecture
2. Encourage a data driven approach to understanding diversity, inclusion, and equity in computer architecture by reading and analyzing scholarly work
3. Bring together a diverse group of computer architecture researchers where everyone has the opportunity to share their experiences and perspectives
4. When possible, invite guest speakers to shed light on their work related to diversity, inclusion, and equity in STEM and computing

## Format

Central to this reading group is enabling anyone interested in joining the reading group has the opportunity to do so. With this in mind the reading group is organized as follows:
1. We organized the summer reading group over 7 sessions from early June to late August.
    1. Each session were around 1 hour long and hosted every two or three weeks
    2. The first 20 minutes of the session the members read the paper, book chapter, or article together (or in the case of a video/audio book listen to the work together). 
    3. The latter 40 minutes of the session the members discussed the presented material in groups of no more than 25. Breakout rooms were used if the attendance was larger than 25. 
    4. Splitting the session into two components will encourage more individuals to join the reading group that may not otherwise read the material beforehand. Individuals that have already read the material on their own may join the second half directly.
2. All sessions are not recorded to encourage participants to share freely and openly.
3. After each session we takes notes (Google doc) for attendees to share pointers to relevant articles, intitiatives, and links.
