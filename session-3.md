## Reading

- **Required**: "The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations as a Barrier to Inclusion for Women" by Cheryan et al.
- **Optional**: "What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You" by Kathryn S. McKinley  

## Discussion questions

1. What stereotypes have you personally heard during your studies in CS/ECE or STEM more generally? Did you feel the stereotypes were something you identified with?
    1. What was your reaction to hearing or reading those stereotypes? Did they deter you from engaging with something you may have been interested in? 
2. The work cites that it highlights U.S.-based studies only. Do you think results would be different for other countries or regions? Do you know of any region-specific stereotypes?
3. What stereotypes of computer scientists and engineers have you seen in the media? (e.g., movies, television, video games, etc.) Which ones stood out to you for either being very authentic, or inauthentic?
4. The authors comment on this common stereotype that computer scientists are “born coding” or “dream in code”? When did you start coding or engineering? 
5. As researchers in CS, do you find having a singular focus or mindset helpful? Or do you often borrow from many different areas into your work? 
6. How important are interpersonal skills to you as a software or hardware engineer? As a researcher? 
7. Being in computer science and engineering already, are there areas of STEM or outside of STEM where you find yourself thinking similar stereotypes as those portrayed in this work about computer science? 
8. How important is it to you to interact with role models that are representative of your background? Do you feel this is important to you personally, or does it not matter?
